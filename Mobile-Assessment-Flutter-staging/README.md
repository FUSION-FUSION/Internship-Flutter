# mobile assessment flutter

## Shipify mobile prototype
#### Structure

I follow a simple structure, based on clean Ui code, refactoring every component for reuseablity and ease of access, like the Text Headers and textField buttons, also the same structure is implement in the app for easy widget testing.

Screens are in a separate folder and all widgets (reusable) are also in a separate folder.

you would notice that there arent many comment as a good code shouldn't have so many comments, but i leave comments where necessary.
